# Northcoders Data Engineering Final Project
This Northcoders Data Engineering Final Project is a pipeline which allows a shop to transform an under-managed SQL database of sales records to a structured data warehouse hosted in amazon web services (AWS) - see Initial Database and Transformed Database entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) below.

1. The pipeline's extraction Lambda function collects both archive and new unique data entries by scanning the database every 2 minutes. It converts the data to CSV files which are stored in an S3 bucket and logs in CloudWatch. The database credentials are stored in Secrets Manager; and Systems Manager is used to store timestamps.
2. A bucket upload event triggers a second processing Lambda function which transforms and normalises the data and stores them in parquet format in a second S3 bucket.
3. Finally, every 2 minutes the second bucket is scanned for updates, which the pipeline converts back to SQL and adds to a data warehouse in star format.

The entire pipeline infrastructure is managed by Terraform.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed the latest version of Python and set up a venv.
* Run make-requirements to install required packages.


## Using the Pipeline
* To run tests, the test SQL databases must be created.

    * Create a .env file in the nc_pipeline directory with the following information:
    ```
    TEST_HOST = 'localhost'
    TEST_DATABASE = 'oltp_test'
    USER = <local sql username>
    PASSWORD = <local sql password>

    TEST_HOST = 'localhost'
    TEST_DATABASE = 'olap_test'
    USER = <local sql username>
    PASSWORD = <local sql password>
    ```

    * Create otlp test database:
    ```
    psql -f tests/test_extraction/data/test-extraction.sql
    ```

    * Create olap test database:
    ```
    psql -f tests/test_storage/data/test-insertion.sql
    ```
    

* To use the pipeline, the AWS CLI must be installed and the OLTP and OLAP credentials known.
